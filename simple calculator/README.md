Hey there!   I built a simple calculator using TypeScript, Node.js, and Inquirer.js. It's perfect for anyone who needs a quick and easy way to crunch some numbers.  The interface is straightforward, so you can jump right in and start adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing! .This project was a great way for me to practice using TypeScript for interactive applications.  Feel free to check out the code and see how it works, or maybe it'll inspire you to build your own calculator with some extra features!
