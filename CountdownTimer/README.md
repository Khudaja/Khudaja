- This project is a simple countdown timer implemented in TypeScript. The timer allows users to input a specific amount of minutes and seconds, then counts down to zero, displaying the remaining time in the format of minutes and seconds. The input is validated to ensure that the minutes are non-negative and the seconds are between 0 and 59. If invalid input is provided, the user is prompted to enter the values again.

 - You can run on your windows powershell by using command:

          npx countdown-timer-k
