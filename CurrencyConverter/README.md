- This TypeScript Currency Converter is a project developed as part of my IT studies, aimed at creating a practical tool for currency conversion using TypeScript. Leveraging real-time exchange rates obtained from a reputable API, this converter offers an efficient solution for converting between different currencies. Whether you're a fellow student, a developer learning TypeScript, or simply someone interested in currency conversion, this project serves as an educational and practical demonstration of TypeScript programming.
