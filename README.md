- This repository is my journey into the world of TypeScript!  I'm building a collection of mini-projects to experiment with the language's features and solidify my understanding.  Each project tackles a different concept, and the code is well-commented to explain my thought process.  Feel free to browse around, learn from my code, and maybe even get inspired to create your own mini-project!
