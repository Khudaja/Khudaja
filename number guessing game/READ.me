The game generates a random number between 1 and 6 (inclusive), and the user has 4 chances to guess the correct number.After each guess, the user receives feedback indicating if their guess is higher or lower than the target number. If the user guesses correctly within the four attempts, they win the game. Otherwise, the game reveals the correct number at the end.
